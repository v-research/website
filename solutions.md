<p>
As a research center, we provide reports and prototypes. Our prototypes are not "just" innovating something which exists, we create the materials for what will be. Our prototypes are based on other prototypes, on unstable grounds. But they solve complex theoretical and engineering challenges such as calculating the (natural) number of security weaknesses in the design of a cyber-physical system. Our code isn't clean, you cannot design ideas, you cannot command how they'll look like. But we look forward to maturate our prototypes with the industry and for the industry.

<p>
We complement customer internal resources providing support from problem statement definition to the engineering and (TRL) maturation plan. We provide extensive review of state-of-the-art commercial products or academic solutions whenever commercial products are not available or don't fit customer needs. We support the customer in platform evaluation and selection, standards and regulations conformance or compliance testing, RFP/tender consultancy, and partnership and security assurance.
