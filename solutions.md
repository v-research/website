We complement customer internal resources providing support from problem statement definition to the engineering and (TRL) maturation plan. We provide extensive review of state-of-the-art commercial products or academic solutions whenever commercial products are not available or don't fit customer needs. We support the customer in platform evaluation and selection, standards and regulations conformance or compliance testing, RFP/tender consultancy, and partnership and security assurance.
